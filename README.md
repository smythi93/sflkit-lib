SFLKit (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3540250.3558915) is an out-of-the-box library and tool for statistical fault 
localization. Statistical fault localization aims at detecting execution features that correlate with failures, such as 
whether individual lines are part of the execution.

## Library

This project contains the library for [SFLKit](https://github.com/uds-se/sflkit/).
